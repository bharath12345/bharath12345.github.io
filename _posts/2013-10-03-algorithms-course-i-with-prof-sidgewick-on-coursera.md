1. Why study Algorithms and Data Structures? Why are they important?
Computers, no matter how powerful, have space and time constraints. Poorly thought through implementations for computing problems can take years to compute even when computing resources are massive. For example -

2. Why learn, re-learn algorithms?
The primary reason to do so is that we are faced, all too often, with completely new computing environments (hardware and software) with new features that old implementations may not use to best advantage
