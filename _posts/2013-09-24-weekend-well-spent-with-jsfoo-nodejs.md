I had been the wonderful JavaScript conference [JSFoo](https://funnel.hasgeek.com/jsfoo2013/) last week. There is tremendous enthusiasm in the web development community for server side JavaScript. Till now in my career I have spent enormous time coding visualization with JavaScript. However only recently did I write some tidbits of code with NodeJS. And have never spent any time to properly study it. The conference spurred me to do better. So I started studying and working on a project to create my first non-trivial NodeJS application which I shall share in this blog. But I shall unveil those details a little later… let me start with JSFoo…

### JSFoo
It was indeed very nice of the Mozilla foundation to have brought in such a wonderful contingent for the meet. It was great to listen to [Robert Nyman](http://robertnyman.com/) speaking on FirefoxOS for mobile devices. I had my first brush with FirefoxOS at the Wikipedia hackathon where I spent some time with it. I feel Android needs a competitor in its segment and FirefoxOS can really be it. I hope it will catch on with the larger community of web developers who will find the JavaScript mobile API good to code. My mobile has got considerably slower as I have inched up to 50+ applications. Mobile should support 1000s of lightweight apps in the near future and I hope it starts with FirefoxOS. (there is a nice 'search app' facility in FirefoxOS)

The second talk I want to write about was that by [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/). He urged web developers to study HTML5 and use it well. Developers continue to use shims and jQuery plugin's for tasks that have made their way to the specs and should be available by default. He asked of the web developers to pound on the doors of the browser makers if any part of the spec is unimplemented or glossed over. Let me admit - I have never read a book on HTML5. I don't remember if I have ever read any book on HTML at all. If someone had suggested reading a book on HTML5 before this talk then I would have responded by saying that I find W3C resources on the web quite sufficient. But after listening to Chris, I won't say so. 

Couple of great talks that will stay with me from this year's JSFoo was from the two  workshops - one by [Bharani Muthukumarswamy](http://bharani.herokuapp.com/) and another by Pankaj Bhageria. Bharani introduced me to MeteorJS and I have promised myself to try it out soon. Pankaj took the pains to introduce the brick-by-brick construction of app built with pure JavaScript stack.

Among the crisp talks, the one that definitely blew my minds was that by [Nilesh Trivedi](http://www.nileshtrivedi.com/) on Interactive Physics Simulations. I would have to watch the video of Nilesh's talk many times over to grasp all that he said. And to build the application that he has without using pre-built frameworks is absolutely astounding! 

Other talks that definitely deserve a mention include the one by Om Shankar on WebRTC, Offline in the Browser by Manan Bharara, Persona based authentication system being brought by Mozilla presented by Francois Marier and the preview of developer tools for the upcoming IE10 by [Rajasekharan Vengalil](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/).


### The making of two blogs…
So I decided to take a little more control of this blog - wrest the server side as well. So created [http://bharathblogs.in](http://bharathblogs.in). So I now have two blogs with identical content - bharathblogs and bharathwrites.

#### bharathwrites.in
Ruby server side hosted by GitHub and

#### bharathblogs.in
