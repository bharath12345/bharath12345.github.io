Last Saturday I happened to go to my first code retreat. Hosted by [Multunus](http://www.multunus.com/) and conducted by the master programmer [Venkat Subramaniam](https://twitter.com/venkat_s) it was a very learnful experience. 

### The Format
Code retreats are day long coding fests. Programmers take a crack at solving [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in multiple short sessions. Each session is for 45 minutes. Developers work in pairs of two (miniature [extreme programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) sessions). Every session starts with a clean slate, that is NO previous code every new session. [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is encouraged. After every 45 minute session is a 15 minute standup to share the experience and things learnt. At the standup the group may decide to impose some constraints for the next session... like not-using-classes, no-global-state, no-returns-from-any-methods and etc. The choice of programming language, frameworks and design is left to the pairing team. 

Generally the 45 minutes time slot is insufficient to solve the puzzle along with writing tests especially if one is a newbie. However, the the learning is not in the solving the puzzle but in the complete experience of walking the way.
