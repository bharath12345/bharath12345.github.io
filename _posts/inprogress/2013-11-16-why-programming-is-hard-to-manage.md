A couple of recent incidents triggered me to write this piece... 

Few weeks ago, I met an old friend. A fellow software industry man. But unlike me, a people manager. As we both shared our our small successes and sorrows in software development, my friend picked on my recently acquired MBA. Give me something I can use my friend demanded. I promised him this blog.

Now the second incident. A month ago I logged into my (almost) discarded yahoo-mail. Had created it in 2001 and used it actively till around 2006 (when Gmail happened). In my yahoo mailbox I found a folder with a few of my musings from my early years as a software engineer.  One was titled 'Bewilderment'. It was a list of processes, decisions and people's actions that were totally counter-intuitive to me. At the end of the piece I had advised myself to study psychology to understand these things!

into  into 'todo' list I had created some 5 years ago. One of the items was *Software Books To Read*. The list, unsurprisingly, had only technical books. I tried to think... if I were to go back and advise myself on the non-technical software industry books to read, then which one would I choose?
     
So here is a short list of books that I would advise anybody to whom the title of this blog is of concern. These are well-known, widely-read bestsellers. But not all programmers would read them in the first decade of their careers. My humble submission - reading these may or may not help you become better programmers. But they will certainly help in oneself understanding the bewilderment that is software development...
