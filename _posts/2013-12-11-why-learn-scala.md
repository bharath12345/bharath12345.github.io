I don't remember the first time I read this masterpiece of an article by the software engineering guru, Peter Norvig - [Teach Yourself Programming In Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers). Peter advises wannabe programmers to learn at least a dozen programming languages. In my decade long career, I have worked deeply in only 4 languages - C++, Java, JavaScript and Perl. So taking stock of myself, about 6 months ago, I had two questions in mind - 

* Why do I need another language? 
* If at all, then which one?

The answer to the first one was rather easy to find. I started by reading what was new in Java-7 and what was coming up in Java-8. Java-7 with its *invoke dynamic* and Java-8 built for writing *lambdas* were clearly pointing the finger in a certain direction. The JVM had started its embrace of Polyglotism and Functional Programming. On little more fact finding, the reasons were easy to realise. Java with its type-safety mess-up, lack of immutable data structures in the JDK to fight the menace of shared mutability and just sheer verbosity, were beginning to weigh heavy on the language. These factors, along with the more and more distributed multicore computing world with its new challenges, convinced me of the need to look to start anew.

Surprisingly, the second question turned out to be the tougher of the two to answer. The choice essentially is between Groovy, Scala and Clojure. I chose Scala. This article is a small attempt to articulate the reasons for the choice as I continue to climb the rather steep learning curve. My pre-learning decision has got richly rewarded by what I have learnt after taking the plunge. This write-up is a little too theoretical. For *show-me-the-code* types, I will soon write about a not-so-small 3-tier application I have built entirely with Scala. 

In this post I will allude to three broad reasons for *Why Learn Scala* -

1. Scala is a great mix. It imbibes some of the best features of other popular, successful languages
2. Scala ecosystem of libraries are mature
3. Some features of Scala that have blown me off and made me an overall better programmer

### Scala Is A Great Mix 

Scala brings in some of the best features from 4 other programming languages -

1. Haskell
2. Erlang
3. C#
4. Java

Let us take a slightly deeper look...

#### Haskell and Scala
These are two interesting surveys -

* [Learning This Language Improved My Ability As A Programmer](http://hammerprinciple.com/therighttool/statements/learning-this-language-improved-my-ability-as-a-pr)
* [LEARNING This Language Significantly Changed How I Use Other Languages](http://hammerprinciple.com/therighttool/statements/learning-this-language-significantly-changed-how-i)

Haskell tops both these lists for a reason. Scala incorporates a lot of Haskell's good features into itself. Here is a short list -

1. Type Inference
2. First Class Functions
3. Currying
4. Lazy Evaluation
5. List Comprehensions
6. Immutability
7. Algebraic Data Types
8. Higher Order Types
9. Monads

One question that begs for an answer - If Haskell is so good, then why not use it itself and why go for Scala? If thats an option then I would definitely encourage you to go ahead. But to those like me who just love the JVM and have a overarching need of platform independency, Scala is a welcome choice.

#### Erlang and Scala
[WhatsApp](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/11/8/stuff-the-internet-says-on-scalability-for-november-8th-2013.html?SSLoginOk=true) gets more messages than Twitter. WhatsApp is built on Erlang. And thats for a reason. To run massively concurrent applications, you need a lot of parallel execution. And Actor based method for concurrency brought in by Erlang is backed by solid academic/research foundations and has also tasted production success. However Erlang takes a thread backed method for its Actor's concurrency. An Erlang process is very lightweight, and Erlang applications commonly have tens-of thousands of threads or more. However thread's are a scarce resource. And in a distributed, horizontally scaling setup the constraints can be quite strict. Scala has two types of Actors: thread-based and event based. Thread based actors execute in heavyweight OS threads. They never block each other, but they donâ€™t scale to more than a few thousand actors per VM. Event-based actors are simple objects. They are very lightweight, and, like Erlang processes, you can spawn millions of them on a modern machine. The difference with Erlang processes is that within each OS thread, event based actors execute sequentially without preemptive scheduling. This makes it possible for an event-based actor to block its OS thread for a long period of time (perhaps indefinitely).

Coming back to a point stated earlier - if you are looking to engineer on the JVM, then Scala's Actor model provides a compelling option for highly scalable and concurrent applications. One can listen to the many talks by the architects Scala Actor model like Jonas Boner and Roland Kuhn to get the idea that its an effort to bring the best of Erlang's proven model to the JVM engineers.

#### C#, Java and Scala
Scala has taken a lot of good things from C# and Java, especially in the syntax area. The syntax seems to have been designed especially keeping the Java programmers in mind, all the while trying to reduce the verbosity. One of the very interesting features that seems to have been inspired by its C# counterpart is [Implicits](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/implicit-conversions-and-parameters.html). They provide a means to extend libraries, help in type conversion etc. 

### Scala Ecosystem
The greatest joy that working with Scala has brought to me is with the library ecosystem. One might be surprised that I say this. There has been quite some furore over backward compatibility of Scala's native libraries over releases 2.7 > 2.8 > 2.9 > 2.10 (present). The Actors model seem to have been written multiple times over - once as native scala.actors, once as part of the Lift library to what one hopes to be the final one - as part of Akka. But I started using Scala after some of these tides have come and gone. Let me first present a list of popular frameworks written and supporting Scala -

Scala natively comes with an excellent collections framework supporting both immutable and mutable collections. Java JDK has no support for immutable collections.

1. [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) for **Concurrency**
2. [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) - **Data structures** for functional programming
3. [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava) - composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences. Not written in Scala but, probably, most neat code if used with Scala! (one will go mad using this with the verbosity of Java) 
4. [ScalaCheck](https://github.com/rickynils/scalacheck) - testing framework with Java equivalent (at least that I know of). Goes much ahead of JUnit etc. Inspired by Haskell's QuickCheck
5. **Object Relational Mapping** -
    a. [Slick](https://github.com/slick/slick) - Database access
6. [SBT](https://github.com/sbt/sbt) - **Build and Packaging Tool** - more concise than Maven. No XML crap - build instructions as Scala DSL
7. **Distributed Big Data Tasks**
    a. [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle) - Fault tolerant, protocol agnostic RPC system
    b. [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding) - MapReduce for Scala
    c. [SummingBird](https://github.com/twitter/summingbird) - Streaming, continuous, real-time MapReduce on top of Scalding or Storm
8. **Web Development** -
    a. Lift for Web Development
    b. Play! for Web Development
    c. Spray.IO for Web Development, RESTful services etc


#### Akka - Concurrency and ESB

Akka allows you to do message passing like you would in a traditional ESB but with speed

#### Spray and Play!

#### Slick
Exposure to new and revisit assumptions on -

1. Type safety
2. Immutable data structures
3. More concise code
4. 

#### RxJava


#### Product Perspective
Its a interesting question - which programming language would you choose to write your next product? 

* If you are a startup web product company, you may choose NodeJS. If you have reliable Ruby expertise then Rails is still a great choice. By the way, no one ever got fired for picking Java. And if you have been slightly out of touch with things lately, then you may end up choosing the old war-horse PHP
* But if the product is for enterprise customers, designers and managers alike tend to favour Java heavily. And not without reasons. The Java ecosystem is stable and rich in libraries and design patterns. Lot of engineering expertise is widely available. And so on...

It is a wise choice of 'picking the right battles'.
