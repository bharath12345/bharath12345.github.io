Over the last three months I have gone through the rigour of two eye-opening coursera courses. I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting to understand programming for the multicore, realtime, big-data. The courses are -

* [Functional Programming Principles In Scala](https://class.coursera.org/progfun-003)
*  [Principles of Reactive Programming](https://class.coursera.org/reactive-001)

I have been trudging on and off with Scala for the latter half of 2013. Written many small programs to understand the core concepts. But doing these two courses have put me on very firm footing. The courses had me working on 12 solid assignments. And not a single one of these took me less than couple of days. The courses assignments cover a lot of ground which includes -

* Composing non-trivial higher order functions
* Mixing object oriented with functional
* Usage of Scala collections along with language built-in's like pattern-matching
* Testing with ScalaTest and ScalaCheck
* Using RxJava and Observables on non-trivial data-set
* Using Akka for Actor based concurrency

Inspired by these assignments, I have been working on few of my own ideas. Three projects specifically and all three are in their infancy. However as I head out with the family for a vacation for the new year, I thought of writing this quick post. One of the new year resolutions is to invest more time and energy into these...

* **Project Goal**: Data bridge between Ganglia (gmond) and ZeroMQ
* **Why?**
  * *Why Ganglia?* Because it is (probably) the worlds most popular open-source data collection tool for large data centres
  * *Why ZeroMQ?* Because it is (probably) the worlds most popular open-source data-bus for high volumes, with API in most programming languages
* **How?**
