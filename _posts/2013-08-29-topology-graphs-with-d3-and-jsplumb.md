There are many traditional areas of graph depictions like computer networks, social networks etc. A while ago, I came across the use-case of graphs for software application topologies. My initial thoughts were that it should be no difficult to model compared to computer network topologies where I had some experience. Not surprisingly, I was off the mark by quite some distance! So this post covers what I discovered about Application topologies and their graph representation.

### Usecase

### Prototype
